                <p class="statement">Since I started this Tech Journey I realised that when you are consistent in doing
                    something you become better and you learn different ways of doing it,and also be determined
                    to get better and be opened minded to learn new things. Even when feel thingd are not going as
                    planned,you have to keep trying.Oscar Widle once said
                <p class="con"><i id="consistent">" Consistency is the last refuge for the unimaginative"</i>. </p>
